## Overview
This project predicts energy consumption using various regression models. The dataset undergoes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model evaluation to determine the best-performing approach.

## Models Used
Linear Regression (LR)
Decision Tree Regression (DT)
Random Forest Regression (RF)
K-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN)

## Dataset
Dataset is taken from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/govindaramsriram/energy-consumption-dataset-linear-regression

## Methodology
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizing energy consumption trends.
Identifying missing values and outliers.
Data Preprocessing
Feature scaling and encoding.
Splitting data into train and validation sets.
Model Training & Evaluation
Comparing models based on RMSE, RÂ², and MAE.
Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.

## Results
The best model is determined based on validation metrics.
Feature importance is analyzed to understand key predictors.

## Future Improvements
Try deep learning models (e.g., ANN, LSTM) for better accuracy.
Implement real-time energy prediction using a Flask API.
